title: "AI-Assist in Firmware: Guardrails that Actually Work"
---

AI can speed up firmware work **if** we constrain it. What works for me:

**Where it helps**
- Boilerplate drivers & unit-test scaffolds
- Log parsers and data munging
- Drafting ICD/ADR templates

**Guardrails**
1. **Test first**: unit test or expected output before accepting AI code
2. **Static analysis + sanitizers** as a gate (CI)
3. **Dual review** for safety paths and memory-bound code
4. **Observability**: DTCs + structured logs enable quick validation

**Result**
- Fewer low-severity review comments on drivers/tests
- Faster triage when combined with structured logs
